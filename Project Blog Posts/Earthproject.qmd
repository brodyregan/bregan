## ASTER Data: Displayed below is an individual project I created for an Earth Science class

These are figures from my independent project from the Earth 104G course at UCSB. My goal was determine geological factors that influence composition and structure of formations in the Anza Borrego region, Southern California. 

In the first map, I used NASA ASTER data to create an overlay of different types of sedimentary rocks shown by the different colors. RASTER Math equations allowed me to take multiple ASTER images and create an RBG image. Based on historical data, we can see how the different compositions of rocks correlate with where ancient river and ocean beds used to be.   

In the second map, I used Digital Elevation Maps from the USGS data system to create a topography map in QGIS. Using other functions, I show where water drains giving insight about how rainfall and rivers formed the divide down the center of the moutain range.
